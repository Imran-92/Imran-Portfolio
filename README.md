## Description
This is a Portfolio website showcasing few of my web application. I used HTML semantic tags to create the skeleton of the webpage and used CSS to style the webpage.
I used CSS properties flex, grid to define the rows and columns and overall layout of the webpage. To make the web page responsive so that it work smoothly on different devices i.e phone,tablet, desktop i used media queries.
